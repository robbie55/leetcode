This repo is for storing all the leetcode problems I've done up until whenever whoever is reading this.

As of right now, as I'm creating it, I'll have some work to do in the form of organizing by problem difficulty (easy, medium, hard)

Each file has my own solution, as well as a revised solution after either failing miserably for hours on end, or after I hacked together something that got accepted!

I will also begin to comment out each file as to explain what my though process was,
and what the actual code is doing in each file
