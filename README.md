This repo is for storing all the leetcode problems I've done up until whenever whoever is reading this.

As of right now, as I'm creating it, I'll have some work to do in the form of organizing by problem difficulty (easy, medium, hard).

Each file has my own solution, as well as a revised solution after either failing miserably for hours on end, or after I hacked together something that got accepted!

I will also begin to comment out each file as to explain what my though process was,
and what the actual code is doing in each file. The ones that you find ARE commented
are likely due to me writing out my thoughts to better visualize / conceptualize the
problem. Could also be because I was proud of the solution and wanted to explain it.

Once I really get a good grasp and have high self esteem with most leet code problems, I'll feel better about commenting them out.
